Conclusion
To check access control: Always filter and check file ownership in your views.

To check encryption: Use the encrypted field in your model, and implement actual encryption in your upload/download logic.

To test: Use two different user accounts and try to access each other’s files.

If you want to implement advanced access control (like role-based or object-level permissions), consider using Django’s built-in permissions or third-party packages
